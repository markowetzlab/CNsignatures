Telomere lengths of deep WGS samples were estimated using the Telomerecat software <http://telomerecat.readthedocs.org/>. 
 
Telomerecat was installed using the python installer:

```{bash, eval=F}
pip install telomerecat
```

Once installed, the following command was used to output a length estimate for a given BAM file:
```{bash, eval=F}
telomerecat bam2length /path/to/bamfile.bam
```
